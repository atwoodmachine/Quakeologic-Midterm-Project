# Quakeologic Midterm Game Mod Project
Welcome to Quakeologic, a survival mod for Quake 4. 

Survival:

The player has 4 new statistics to keep an eye on: hunger, exhaustion, thirst, and infection. If hunger, exhaustion, or thirst reach 100, the player's health will passively tick down. If several stats are at their maximum, the player's health will decrease proportionally with the number of stats that are critical. If infection reaches its maximum, the player dies. You can lower your hunger by eating food, lower your thirst by drinking water, and lower your exhaustion by eating coffee beans (note that this also damages your health. Just like real life.). These options are available in the Menkhu Craft screen through the pause menu. 

Infection:

To manage infection, the player first needs to identify which layer the infection lies on: blood, bones, or nerves, to treat with the proper antibiotic. To identify the layer, the player needs to reveal symptoms using tinctures. 

Crafting:

Tinctures and medicines may be crafted through the "Menkhu Craft" screen located in the pause menu. Simply click on the buttons and crafting will be done automatically, consuming the appropriate ingredients.

Crafting recipes:

1 water + 1 white twyre + 1 red twyre = 1 blood tincture 

1 water + 1 white twyre + 1 green twyre = 1 bone tincture 

1 water + 1 red twyre + 1 green twyre = 1 nerves tincture

1 swevery + 1 red twyre = 1 Neomycinium

1 swevery + 1 red twyre = 1 Ferromycinium 

1 swevery + 1 green twyre = 1 Monomycinium

Tinctures:

Tinctures are used in diagnosis, revealing symptoms on their respective layer. Be careful when diagnosing, tinctures are a limited resource. 

Diagnostics:

The diagnostics screen is located on the player HUD. Initially, you have no symptoms revealed. 

Press the 8 key to reveal a symptom on the blood layer (this consumes a blood tincture).

Press the 9 key to reveal a symptom on the bones layer (this consumes a bone tincture).

Press the 0 key to reveal a symptom on the nerves layer (this consumes a nerves tincture).

Some layers have overlapping symptoms. For example, the center symptom is shared by all layers. By observing which symptoms overlap, the player must diagnose which layer the disease resides in. Then the player may craft the appropriate antibiotic to treat themselves with: Neomycinium for bones, Ferromycinium for blood, and Monomycinium for nerves. If you use the incorrect antibiotic, your infection will not go down. Note that antibiotics damage your health, regardless of whether or not you use the correct one.
